Become a VIM power user with tabs. Type `:tabedit myfile` to open any file in a new tab. Use `gt` to view the new tab. Closing the tab is as easy as `:q`. The shortcut for `tabedit` is `tabe`. More info at `:help tabs`
Basics are good. Things like `ZZ` to save 'n' exit like a pro, `u` to undo the last command, and `Ctrl-r` to redo the last undone command. FYI, these are to be run in *normal mode*.
Who says VIM doesn't have word completion? Use `Ctrl-n` to get a full list of every word used in all open buffers. Use `Ctrl-p` to go back one if you went too far. It also helps to type the first one or two letters of the word you're looking for.
A handy way to jump to the next matching word under the cursor is to type `*` in *normal mode*.
`:split` or `:vsplit` can be used to open multiple buffers (files) in the same window. Use the `Ctrl-w` command combinations to move between split windows. `Ctrl-w` + movement (hjkl or arrow keys) will go to a window in that direction. `Ctrl-w`+`q` will close the current buffer.

Use `:read !{your_cmd}` to insert the standard output of <your_cmd> below the cursor. This will automatically put the console text output in the file for you. Pretty powerful stuff. Try `:r !date` out for size.
VIM has some useful variables to take advantage of. `%` represents the current buffer (file) and `#` represents the last buffer in the current editing session. Try it out with some files of your own! Open some file then type `:e file2` where file2 is another filename. Then type `:e #` to open the first file again. `Ctrl-6` is the shortcut for that.
