The Pi Clock
---

## Inspiration

It has occurred to me that having a clock in my room is a must-have. So much time can be wasted 
from checking either the nearest phone or computer screen as the distractions are inevitble. I 
know, it's a small thing, but to me it makes a huge difference. Also, it's nice to have a simple 
project like this by which I can hone my electronics and programming skills.

## Materials Necessary

* Raspberry Pi 2 or 3
* 4-digit 7-segment display module
* 12 jumper wires (male to female)
* Breadboard
* Box of some kind to house the clock

## Wiring

> Picture of Fritzing diagram will go here

> Table of pin connections (maybe RasPi pinout table)

## Code Commentary

> Note that while the code for this project is in Python 2.7, it will still work in Python 3.X.
